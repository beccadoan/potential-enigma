  ## Installation

  clone the code locally, change directories into the develop branch to run npm install, then cd back to the root directory. From there run node Develop/index.js to run the project.

  ## Usage

  One usage example would be this file you are currently reading! I used this project to create this file for me. When you run the app, you just iput information about your project, and when complete, a README.md file will be generated in the Develop/dist folder of the project!
